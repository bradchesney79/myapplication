This app is for tweaked out Charlie Sheen fans everywhere. The more like Charlie, the better the app will seem.

The .apk is downloadable as such [https://github.com/bradchesney79/myapplication/blob/master/app/build/outputs/apk/app-debug.apk](https://github.com/bradchesney79/myapplication/blob/master/app/build/outputs/apk/app-debug.apk)

And here is a video of what it does. [https://youtu.be/xW4j-YG8vS4]{https://youtu.be/xW4j-YG8vS4) I am not putting this app on my phone and you shouldn't have to either...

Why? Because My Android Studio upgrade didn't go smoothly and I needed to make it work with something simple. And why not Charlie Sheen-- he's got a lot of great things like a billion crazy photos and most importantly a Charlie Sheen centric lorem ipsum type text generator...
